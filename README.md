# Classification and Regression using ANN
This is the first programming assignment of Deep Learning course offered at IIT Mandi. The assignment includes perceptron learning for classification as well as regression tasks and also includes developing a Multilayer Feedforward NN from scratch in python and gives a way to extract Bag of Visual Words from Image Dataset.


## For running the code

- Make sure all the files and dataset are in the same directory. 
- For Classification on images file and also on BoVW file, do remember to create folders which will store resized images before running the code.
- You may have to re-run the code while training a neural network as much depends on initialization of parameters which has been done by random function in the code.
